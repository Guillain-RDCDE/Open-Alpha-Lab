# Open-Alpha-Lab

### An open quant research desk.

I take famous trading ideas — anomalies, folk strategies, things people swear by —
put each through the **same brutal protocol**, and publish the verdict: **edge or mirage.**

***Most are mirages. The honest write-up of why is the point.***

> Built by someone who ran the real thing — a fully systematic global-macro book scaled
> from sub-\$100M to **\$9B+ in monthly traded notional** — so every idea is judged on the
> two questions most repos skip: **is the signal real?** *and* **does it survive real
> execution and scale?**

## How it works

Every idea goes through the *same* protocol and earns **two stamps**, so results are comparable:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Signal** — is the effect statistically real? | ![Real](https://img.shields.io/badge/Real-2ea44f?style=flat-square) ![Weak](https://img.shields.io/badge/Weak-dab617?style=flat-square) ![None](https://img.shields.io/badge/None-c0392b?style=flat-square) |
| **Tradability** — does it survive costs, capacity & scale? | ![Investable](https://img.shields.io/badge/Investable-2ea44f?style=flat-square) ![Fragile](https://img.shields.io/badge/Fragile-dab617?style=flat-square) ![Mirage](https://img.shields.io/badge/Mirage-c0392b?style=flat-square) |

Robust inference (Newey-West / Lo SEs, bootstrap CIs, White Reality Check for data-snooping),
an honest alpha-vs-beta split, and a square-root market-impact capacity test — the full house
style is written up in **[METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md)**.

---

## The map

The whole bench on one grid — every study is a numbered chip, sorted by its two stamps.
Almost everything ends up bottom-right; two chips are green — and neither one predicts returns.

![The bench map — every study placed on a Signal × Tradability grid](docs/bench_map.png)

The counts, the mortality by family of idea, and the five lessons the bench keeps
teaching are in **[What 87 teardowns taught us](docs/bench.md)**.

> **Click any study** for the full teardown — two narrative notebooks (one for the curious,
> one for the quant), reproducible code, and every number behind the two stamps.

*In the queue:* the weekend effect, the payday anomaly, paired switching,
a VIX term-structure follow-up. Suggestions welcome via issues.

## Run it

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows:  .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1   |   *nix:  source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

pytest -q                                                            # the engine's test-suite
python studies/01-overnight-anomaly/examples/run_synthetic_demo.py   # offline, no network
```

Then open **[studies/01-overnight-anomaly/](studies/01-overnight-anomaly/)** — start with the
notebook *for the curious*, or read the working paper.

To verify the published numbers byte-for-byte (data caches, fingerprints, release bundle), see **[docs/reproducibility.md](docs/reproducibility.md)**.
