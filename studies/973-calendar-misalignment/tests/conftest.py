"""Shared fixtures for Study 973 — deterministic, offline, no network.

The planted world is a pair of assets driven by one common factor with a **known**
correlation, where one of them observes the factor a day late (stale pricing). The null is the
same pair observed synchronously, where every estimator must recover the true correlation and
every "fix" must leave it alone.

Both worlds come from the same generator with one knob moved, which is the whole point:
a test that passes on the planted world and *also* passes on the null is not testing
anything.
