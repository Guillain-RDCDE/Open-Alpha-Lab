"""Shared fixtures for Study 998 — deterministic, offline, no network.

The planted world generates two series whose true hedge ratio follows a random
walk with a known variance. Because the truth is observable, every estimator can be graded on
tracking error against it rather than against another estimate — which is the only way to
separate "adapts fast" from "adapts to noise".

Both worlds come from the same generator with one knob moved, which is the whole point:
a test that passes on the planted world and *also* passes on the null is not testing
anything.
