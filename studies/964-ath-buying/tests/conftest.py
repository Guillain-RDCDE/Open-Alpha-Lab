"""Shared fixtures for Study 964 — deterministic, offline, no network.

The planted world is a panel whose expected returns carry a persistent component
(so trend, and therefore genuine information in "at a high", exists); the null world is the
same machinery with that component switched off, leaving a random walk with drift, where a
record high must carry no information whatsoever about what comes next.

Both worlds come from the same generator with one knob moved, which is the whole point:
a test that passes on the planted world and *also* passes on the null is not testing
anything.
