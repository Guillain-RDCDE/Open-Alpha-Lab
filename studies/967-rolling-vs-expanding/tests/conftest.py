"""Shared fixtures for Study 967 — deterministic, offline, no network.

The planted world has stable parameters, where an expanding window must win because
more data is strictly more information. The null-flavoured world here is the opposite of the
usual one: the same generator with ``signal_strength = 0`` removes the persistent component,
which is the setting where a short window is estimating pure noise.

Both worlds come from the same generator with one knob moved, which is the whole point:
a test that passes on the planted world and *also* passes on the null is not testing
anything.
