"""Shared fixtures for Study 991 — deterministic, offline, no network.

The planted world draws from a Student-*t* whose tail index is set exactly, with
an optional volatility-clustering process on top. Because the true kurtosis at every horizon can
be computed in closed form for the i.i.d. case, the measurement apparatus can be graded against
an exact answer rather than against another estimate.

Both worlds come from the same generator with one knob moved, which is the whole point:
a test that passes on the planted world and *also* passes on the null is not testing
anything.
