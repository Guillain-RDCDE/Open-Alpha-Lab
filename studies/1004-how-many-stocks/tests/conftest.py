"""Shared fixtures for Study 1004 — deterministic, offline, no network.

The synthetic cross-section has a **tunable** average pairwise correlation and
a tunable dispersion of individual expected returns. Those two knobs control the two curves
separately: correlation sets where the volatility curve flattens, while return dispersion sets
how long the terminal-wealth curve keeps falling. Being able to move them independently is what
makes the study's central claim testable rather than merely asserted.

Both worlds come from the same generator with one knob moved, which is the whole point:
a test that passes on the planted world and *also* passes on the null is not testing
anything.
